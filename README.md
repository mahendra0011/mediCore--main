- Backend API: `https://medicore-main.onrender.com/api`

---

## 📄 Key Features in Detail

### Notification System (Fixed)

**Bug Fixed:** Doctor notifications were not appearing due to ID mismatch between Doctor._id and User._id.

**Solution:**
- Notification creation routes accept `doctorId` (Doctor._id), look up Doctor to get `user_id`, and store `userId = doctor.user_id`
- Notification fetching for doctors resolves `req.user._id` (User._id from JWT) back to Doctor's user_id via `Doctor.findOne({ user_id: req.user._id })`
- All doctor-triggered notifications (appointments, emergency assignment, payment received) now correctly deliver to the doctor's notification inbox

**Admin & Patient flows remain unchanged.**

---

### Billing Workflow

1. **Invoice Creation** (`POST /billing`)
   - Triggered by: Doctor creates bill for patient
   - Patient receives: "New Invoice" notification

2. **Payment** (`PUT /billing/:id/pay` or `PUT /billing/:id` with status='Paid')
   - Patient pays through payment UI
   - System marks invoice as Paid
   - Patient receives: "Payment Successful" notification
   - Doctor receives: "Payment Received" notification (with amount and patient name)

---

### Appointment Lifecycle

1. **Patient** books appointment → selects doctor from dropdown (sends `doctorId: Doctor._id`)
2. System calls `createNotification(doctorId, ...)` → looks up Doctor → stores notification with `doctor.user_id`
3. **Doctor** logs in → JWT contains `User._id`
4. Doctor requests `/notifications` → system looks up `Doctor` where `user_id = JWT User._id` → returns matching notifications
5. Doctor sees notification bell update and list of notifications

---

### PDF Report Generation

All PDFs are generated server-side using PDFKit and can be downloaded/printed:

- **Prescription**: Includes patient info, doctor signature, medications table, diagnosis
- **Lab Report**: Test results with units, ranges, doctor's notes
- **Discharge Summary**: Complete hospitalization summary

Accessible from Medical Records page or directly from PDFReports page.

---
